# Assignment 28

For this assignment you will be using a 2-dimensional array to create a tic-tac-toe board (3 x 3).

## First Step

Use a 2D array to create your board. Then, display the board. Each "empty" space should show a number 1-9 that corresponds to the space.
The board should also have the "look" of a tic-tac-toe board. Look below for an example.

Once you can display a grid, make it possible to place pieces (X's and O's).

Note: your final program will have to use two classes (runner + one other class). For day one I am not requiring that you start with two classes,
but it would probably be a good idea to at least think about the methods you would be using in your class.

Convert int to String: Integer.toString(num)

Convert int to char: Character.forDigit(num, 10)

### Sample Outputs

```
1    |    2    |    3    
------------------------
4    |    5    |    6    
------------------------
7    |    8    |    9 
```
